# Getting Started with Web Development in 2025

Web development has evolved significantly over the years, and 2025 brings exciting new possibilities. In this guide, we'll explore the essential tools and technologies you need to know.

## 1. The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Before diving into modern frameworks, it's crucial to master the basics. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS Fundamentals

Modern CSS has become incredibly powerful. Here's a quick example of a responsive layout:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## 2. Modern JavaScript Features

ES2025 brings some exciting features to JavaScript. Here's what you need to know:

```javascript
// Using the latest features
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
  }
};
```

}

// Instead of
function calc(i) {
  let t = 0;
  for(let x of i) t += x.p;
  return t;
}
```
